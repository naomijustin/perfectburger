## Overview of Project
A survey form to customize your perfect burger. Vegan options available.
 
## Process
* The survey form was to be similar in terms of elements to Free Code Camp's Survey form:
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP

* I wanted to create my own unique version, and to ensure that it was illustration heavy to create a modern aesthetic. I decided I wanted to have a colourful theme however wanted to try and stick with a limited colour palette.
 
### Inspiration
* https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel | I used this tool to input colours I wanted to include and used different colour harmony to choose remaining colours.

### Design
* I used Procreate on the iPad Pro 10.5" to mockup a design, using a flat illustration style and included a colour palette at the bottom of the page.
